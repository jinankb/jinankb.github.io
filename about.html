                    An ongoing, everyday SEARCH/ RESEARCH forms/ informs the basis of my work in the area of design as well as education. The
                    areas of research includes creativity, learning process, children, cognition, culture, aesthetic sense,
                    indigenous knowledge, authenticity, waste, sustainability, originality, sense, body, ways of knowing,
                    psychology, philosophy, politics, ecological awareness and sensitivity etc.  My own DESIGN PRACTICE is
                    undertaken as a culturally, socially and ecologically responsible activity in order to revive /support
                    the traditional handicraft sector as a collaborative effort with artisans. Activities include identifying
                    potential products, design development as well as empowering the artisan.
                </p>
                <p>EDUCATION is a misnomer and what I am engaged with is more of co exploration to reclaim what is lost due
                    to formal schooling-creativity, freedom, originality, autonomy and body related cognitive skills. Works
                    with students of design, architecture, art etc and also with teachers and parents and anybody interested
                    in addressing the damages of schooling. My ACTIVISM is directed to addressing the damages (alienation,
                    fragmentation and homogenization) of modernity and reclaiming authenticity, originality, diversity and
                    rootedness to culture and nature.
