            <div class="content links">
                <p>From 1993 till about 2006 I have been working with potters of Aruvacode village learning/ imbibing the being-ness
                    of non-literate people and at the same time trying to revitalize the dying tradition of pottery.

                    <br> The basic approach in working with artisan is to enable them to create without any inputs. See detailed
                    philosophy at
